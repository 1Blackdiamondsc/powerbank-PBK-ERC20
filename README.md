the future of our financial system. From creating an Insurance, a token or a complete
election voting system, blockchain technology is now allowing anyone anytime
anywhere to replace and disrupt complete market sectors, and all of this with just few
lines of code. Whole government functions and institutions are now being created with
what we call trustless trust, without any central authority in the middle to block
it.Powerbank contribution to this great ecosystem will be to attempt to introduce a new
payment gateway for smartphone world & recharging management.this approach is
transparent, fair and shared by all the participants with the consideration of containing
the supply for a future smartphone world.
